Flickr Gallery v1.5.2_modified
==============================

Use easy shortcodes to insert Flickr galleries and photos (and videos) in your blog.

This is a modified version of the plugin written by Dan Coulter <http://dancoulter.com/>, modified to handle SSL. 

The plugin will now no longer include non-ssl resources in a secure site, handles new SSL requirements on the Flickr API, and handles collisions with the [flickr] shortcode.

Placed here because I couldn't see an obvious patch submission policy on the plugin site, and the author's website has not been updated since 2011, so I am operating under the assumption it is no longer being maintained.
