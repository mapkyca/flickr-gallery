Flickr Gallery v1.5.2_modified
==============================

Use easy shortcodes to insert Flickr galleries and photos (and videos) in your blog.

This is a modified version of the plugin written by Dan Coulter <http://dancoulter.com/>, modified to handle SSL. 

The plugin will now no longer include non-ssl resources in a secure site.

Placed here because I couldn't see an obvious patch submission policy on the plugin site.
